# **Chapter 9: Big Data and Distributed SQL**

---

In the era of big data, SQL has evolved to support distributed processing across massive datasets. Platforms like Hive, Spark SQL, Presto, and BigQuery allow querying large datasets efficiently.

---

## **9.1 Distributed Query Processing**

Distributed SQL processes data spread across multiple nodes in a cluster. This section explores key platforms for distributed query processing.

---

### **9.1.1 Hive**

Apache Hive facilitates querying large datasets stored in Hadoop.

**Example**: Query sales data in a Hive table.
```sql
SELECT ProductID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductID
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### **9.1.2 Spark SQL**

Spark SQL combines the power of distributed computing with SQL.

**Example**: Calculate average sales per region using Spark SQL.
```sql
SELECT Region, AVG(SalesAmount) AS AvgSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region;
```

---

### **9.1.3 Presto**

Presto is optimized for low-latency querying across heterogeneous data sources.

**Example**: Join data from two tables stored in different formats.
```sql
SELECT a.CustomerID, a.Name, b.TotalPurchase
FROM MySQL.Customers a
JOIN Hive.Purchases b ON a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID
WHERE b.TotalPurchase > 1000;
```

---

### **9.1.4 BigQuery**

Google BigQuery supports SQL queries on petabyte-scale data with ease.

**Example**: Query web traffic logs in BigQuery.
```sql
SELECT Page, COUNT(*) AS Views
FROM `project.dataset.web_logs`
WHERE Date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY Page
ORDER BY Views DESC;
```

---

## **9.2 Advanced Distributed Techniques**

Advanced techniques like parallel execution, columnar storage, and query federation further optimize distributed SQL systems.

---

### **9.2.1 Parallel Query Execution**

Parallelism splits large queries into smaller tasks executed concurrently.

**Example**: Parallelize an aggregation query in Spark SQL.
```sql
SELECT ProductCategory, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductCategory;
```

---

### **9.2.2 Columnar Storage**

Columnar storage formats like Parquet and ORC improve performance by reading only relevant columns.

**Example**: Querying a Parquet file in Hive.
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE SalesData (
    ProductID INT,
    SalesAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    SaleDate DATE
)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/data/sales/';
```

---

### **9.2.3 Query Federation**

Query federation allows accessing data across multiple systems.

**Example**: Query MySQL and BigQuery datasets in Presto.
```sql
SELECT a.OrderID, b.ProductName
FROM MySQL.Orders a
JOIN BigQuery.Products b ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID;
```

---

### **9.2.4 Cost Optimization in Distributed SQL**

Reduce costs by optimizing queries and storage strategies.

**Techniques**:
1. **Partitioning**: Divide data into logical segments for faster access.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Sales (
       ProductID INT,
       SaleAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
       SaleDate DATE
   ) PARTITIONED BY (SaleDate);
   ```
2. **Materialized Views**: Store precomputed query results for repeated use.
   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW TopSellingProducts AS
   SELECT ProductID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
   FROM Sales
   GROUP BY ProductID;
   ```
